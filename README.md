# Voice Assistant Powered by LangChain

Welcome to the Voice Assistant repository! This project leverages the power of LangChain to create an intelligent voice assistant capable of understanding and responding to natural language queries. The assistant is designed to be highly customizable, easily extensible, and can be integrated into various applications.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes advanced NLP models to understand and process user queries.
- **Conversational AI**: Maintains context-aware conversations with users, providing relevant and coherent responses.
- **Modular Design**: Built with a modular architecture to allow easy addition of new skills and functionalities.
- **Integration Ready**: Can be integrated with popular messaging platforms, smart home devices, and custom applications.
- **Voice Recognition**: Supports speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities for a seamless voice interaction experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-assistant-langchain.git
   cd voice-assistant-langchain
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Requirements

Create a `requirements.txt` file in the root directory of your project and add the following dependencies:

```
langchain
openai
requests
```

These are the basic dependencies required to run the voice assistant. Additional dependencies may be added as you expand the functionality.

### Usage

1. Start the voice assistant:

   ```sh
   streamlit run speech_client.py
   ```

2. Interact with the assistant using your voice or by typing queries.

### Code Sample

Here is a sample code to get you started with the voice assistant:

```python
import langchain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

# Initialize the LLM with your OpenAI API key
llm = OpenAI(api_key='your-api-key')

# Create a conversation chain
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=llm, verbose=True)

# Start the conversation loop
while True:
    query = input("You: ")
    if query.lower() in ["exit", "quit"]:
        print("Goodbye!")
        break
    response = conversation.predict(input=query)
    print(f"Assistant: {response}")
```

This sample initializes a conversation chain using LangChain and handles user input in a loop, allowing for continuous interaction with the voice assistant.

### Customization

To add new skills or modify existing ones, follow these steps:

1. Create a new skill file in the `skills` directory.
2. Define the necessary functions and logic for your skill.
3. Register the new skill in the `skills/__init__.py` file.
